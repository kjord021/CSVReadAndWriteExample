# CSVReadAndWriteExample

A coding challenge created to Read a CSV file and seperate the content of that file into seperate CSV files based on some of the information within that file. 
The CSV file uploaded is an example of what the structure of one of those files should look like I created it using a CSV randomizer online.
The outputted files should be created within the project directory.
